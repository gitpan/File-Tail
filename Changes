Revision history for Perl extension File::Tail.

0.01  Fri Nov 28 09:44:06 1997
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.18

0.5   Fri Nov 28 12:25:13 MET 1997
	- original version; created by matija.grabnar@arnes.si

0.6   Thu Dec  4 14:16:59 MET 1997
	- assigning error values to $! didn't work. Replaced with croaks.
	- passing only the filename didn't work.

0.7   Mon Jun  1 17:23:23 MET 1998
        - implemented tied interface
	- implemented non-blocking read (against my better judgement)
        - implemented more flexible error handling a-la Net::Telnet
        - implemented ignore_nonexistat

        Release of 0.7 was delayed because I wanted to see if Tied
        Handle handling will include select in 5.005. After two people
        sent me their tied interfaces, I figured maybe it was time to
        release it before implementing select :-)

0.8     Wed Oct 14 19:29:30 MET DST 1998
	implemented wantarray handling in READLINE
	implemented some tests for make test
        documented the tied interface in synopsis (Duh!)
        - implemented tail -n functionality

0.81    Thu Oct 15 07:54:36 MET DST 1998
	There was a bug in tail -n part, and the tail -n tests were missing
           from the distribution
