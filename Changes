Revision history for Perl extension File::Tail.

0.01  Fri Nov 28 09:44:06 1997
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.18

0.5   Fri Nov 28 12:25:13 MET 1997
	- original version; created by matija.grabnar@arnes.si

0.6   Thu Dec  4 14:16:59 MET 1997
	- assigning error values to $! didn't work. Replaced with croaks.
	- passing only the filename didn't work.

0.7   Mon Jun  1 17:23:23 MET 1998
        - implemented tied interface
	- implemented non-blocking read (against my better judgement)
        - implemented more flexible error handling a-la Net::Telnet
        - implemented ignore_nonexistat

        Release of 0.7 was delayed because I wanted to see if Tied
        Handle handling will include select in 5.005. After two people
        sent me their tied interfaces, I figured maybe it was time to
        release it before implementing select :-)

0.8     Wed Oct 14 19:29:30 MET DST 1998
	implemented wantarray handling in READLINE
	implemented some tests for make test
        documented the tied interface in synopsis (Duh!)
        - implemented tail -n functionality

0.81    Thu Oct 15 07:54:36 MET DST 1998
	There was a bug in tail -n part, and the tail -n tests were missing
           from the distribution

0.85	Wed Oct 28 15:44:47 MET 1998
	The introduction of tail -n broke the handling of files where 
	a line might be written incompletely (e.g. without the final \n). OOps!

0.90    Tue Nov 10 11:02:35 MET 1998
	fix for reset_tail (it couldn't be set to 0) from 
	   Chris_Heller/PeopleSoft@peoplesoft.com
	fixed some -> references which complained in Perl5.4 but not in 5.5
        moved debugging statement to a separate routine, logit
        logit now outputs the name of the calling routine and the name of the
           file the object refers to.
        select functionality added.
